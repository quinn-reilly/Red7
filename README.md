#Overview
This is a single-player implementation of the card game Red7. 
In this solitaire version, the player aims to manage their hand of cards 
and meet the current winning condition to stay in the game. The game
is easy to learn but requires strategic thinking as players can change the rules each turn.

Change the winning rule by playing a card to the canvas.
Winning Condition: The rule defines what it means to win (e.g., highest card wins for "Red").
End of Game: The game ends when you play a card that does not meet the winning condition, or the deck is empty.
