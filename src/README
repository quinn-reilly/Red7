Changes from previous implementation:
- Abstract class SoloModel created, in order to minimize code duplication
  -> code refactored from SoloRedGameModel into SoloModel
- test classes TestController and TestModel refactored from inner packages into the
  cs3500.solored package
- Many tests originally in TestModel are now inside AbstractTestModel,
  to minimize code duplication as these tests work with either model.
